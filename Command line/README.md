# We'll be messing with the command line

I'll run a series of tests and document the outcome/output. Most likely we're going to break it, which is fine since it's all virtual, no physical damage.
I'll be doing these tests in Ubuntu server, a cloned version of it, so my main ubuntu server stays instact. We gotta use the :

``` bash

--no-preserve--root
```
so we can overrun the failsafe. After this is pretty much job done, good luck restarting and backing up the files, because it will be a headache, I think there's a way, but I'm too much of a beginner yet.

    #server #testing #commandline
