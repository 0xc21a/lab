# We'll be messing with the command line

I'll run a series of tests and document the outcome/output. Most likely we're going to break it, which is fine since it's all virtual, no physical damage.
I'll be doing these tests in Ubuntu server, a cloned version of it, so my main ubuntu server stays instact.

    #server #testing #commandline
