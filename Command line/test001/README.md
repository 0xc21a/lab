# RM -RF / 

I tried this the first time and the command line advised me not to perform it, so it's a myth you can erase everything out of nowhere. I ran again with a written
permission and I completely destroyed my virtual ubuntu server. I couldn't use ls properly, although I could use shutdown command, I saw Rob doing it and it was lacking, so
I assume it didn't totally destroy my machine, just the important stuff(XD).

     #rmrf #ubuntu #commandline #shutdown
