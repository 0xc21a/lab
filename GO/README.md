# golang syntax

A golang syntax consists of three main parts:

1. Package declaration( what are we working with?)
2. Import package ( now we're talking business)
3. Statements and Functions

### Package declaration

```go

package main

```

### Import packages

```go

import ("fmt")

```

### Statements and functions

```go

func main() {
fmt.println("hello world!")
}
